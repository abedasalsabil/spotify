# Spotify
Project Title: Spotify Most Popular Songs Predictions
Group Members: Abeda Salsabil, Han Yu, Khevana Patel, Sumaiya Nathani

## Getting started
1. The Resources used for the model may be found in the "abedasalsabil spotify main Resources" folder.
2. Our training models are performed using jupyter notebook files available in the "abedasalsabil spotify main cleaning%20" folder.
3. To run the HTML to see the barchart data correlating to each audio feature, run `python -m http.server 8000` in the integrated terminal in VS code, within the static folder. Click the link provided. 
4. Link to visualizations in Tableau: https://public.tableau.com/views/proj4_16866329241620/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link 

## Project Description/Outline: 
The goal of our project is to create a model that predicts the potential popularity of a song and its probability of being in the Top 50 Songs in the world, based on specific factors used to determine what makes a song popular within current times. 

## Research Questions to Answer: 
What audio features make a song popular within the current times?
